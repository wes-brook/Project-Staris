# Project-Staris
This is an ongoing project that sparked from the curiosity of visualizing social networks as constellation patterns much like you would see under a clear night sky.

As this project is currently in the planning phase, proof of concept models have been made with Python3 and NetworkX (Graph Visualization Software) that represent social networks. Once satisfied with these models, we plan to integrate these ideas into a website where users can freely open this project from any device.

In this website, the input for which users provide will be brought to life in a dynamic visualization that will display their social network like never before.
