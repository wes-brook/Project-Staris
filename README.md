**Project Staris | a website in progess**

This is an ongoing project that sparked from the curiosity of visualizing social networks as constellation patterns much like you would see under a clear night sky.

As this project is currently in the planning phase, proof of concept models have been made with Python3 and NetworkX (Graph Visualization Software) that represent social networks. Once satisfied with these models, we plan to integrate these ideas into a website where users can freely open this project from any device.

In this website, the input for which users provide will be brought to life in a dynamic visualization that will display their social network like never before.



### Background
- Building a platform for people to observe their social network.
- Adding meaning to peoples lives by helping them visualize who they know using stars.
### The Problem
- What is the problem? 
    - People fail to realize how big their social network actually is.
- Why does it matter to the user?
    - Raises user awareness of their connections. 
    - Providing insight and a fresh perspective on who they know.
### Our Approach
- Create visual/interactive images of a user's social network using pre-existing software for graph generation (Gephi). 
- This will be a website that has a space aesthetic where stars will represent individual people and constellations will represent particular groups of people. 
    - React will serve as our main framework for web development.
- Users can see their connections in the form of constellations, and the brightness of each star will reflect how close the user is to that person.
### Goals & Success
- What are the goals?
    - Build a website.
- How do we define success and what metrics will we use to measure it?
    - Success will be determined by how well this project is  coordinated.
### Features
- User Accounts
- Interactive UI for the visual network
- Various statistical models to choose from that shape how the network is displayed
### User Flows & Mocks

### Open and Closed Questions
- What remains to be discussed?
    - If this should be a website or mobile app. Can it be both?
- What have we already discussed and decided on?
    - Make a cool space thing.
